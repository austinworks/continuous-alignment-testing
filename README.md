# Continuous Alignment Testing (CAT) Framework

A framework for implementing Continuous Alignment Testing (CAT) for LLM-based applications.

## Overview

CAT provides the infrastructure to:

- Run and track automated tests against an AI application.
- Store and analyze AI test results over iterations.
- Monitor reliability changes in an AI application as prompts, models, code, and data evolve.
- Integrate AI tests into the CI pipeline.
- Build the AI application as an API service.
- Ensure AI applications are reliable while maintaining creativity.
- Iterate on prompts and code while measuring improvements.

## Example Apps
